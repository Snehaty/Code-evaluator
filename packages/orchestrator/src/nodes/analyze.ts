/**
 * ANALYZE node — evaluates each requirement against gathered evidence.

 * 🤖 LLM: YES (reads evidence, produces verdict + rationale per requirement)
 * 📡 GitHub API: NO
 *
 * The node now sees the FILE TREE as well as the file contents. It used to see
 * only the contents, which made `additionalFilesNeeded` a guess assembled from
 * import statements — and every bad guess came back as error text in the next
 * prompt. Giving it the tree is what makes the loop-back worth having.

REQUIREMENTS:
${requirementsList}

EVIDENCE (file contents already read from the repository):
${renderEvidence(state)}

FILE TREE (files that exist but have NOT been read yet — request from this list only):
${available || "  (every file has been read)"}

RULES:
1. Evaluate EACH requirement independently. Return a separate verdict for each, using the exact IDs above.
2. Verdict must be exactly "satisfied" or "not_satisfied".
3. Your rationale MUST be in natural language ONLY. You may reference file paths (e.g. "src/auth.ts, lines 15-30") but NEVER paste, quote, or reproduce any actual source code, variable names, function signatures, import statements, or code snippets of any kind.
4. ${forceDecision ? "You MUST make a final decision now. Set needsMoreEvidence to false." : `If you genuinely cannot determine a verdict with the current evidence, set needsMoreEvidence to true and list up to ${MAX_PLANNED_FILES} specific files from the FILE TREE above. Do not invent paths.`}
5. A file shown as [FILE NOT FOUND] is evidence that it does not exist at the claimed commit — treat its absence as a finding, not as a reason to ask again.
6. Be rigorous but fair. A requirement is "satisfied" if the code demonstrates a reasonable implementation of what's described, not necessarily a perfect one.`;
