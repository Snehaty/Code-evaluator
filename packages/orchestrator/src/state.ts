/**
 * The graph's channels.
 *
 * Two rules hold everywhere below:
 *
 * 1. **Nothing here holds a credential.** The GitHubReadTool moved to
 *    `config.configurable` (see context.ts), so every channel is plain data and
 *    the whole state is serialisable.
 * 2. **A file reference always carries its repo.** The planner used to emit
 *    bare path strings, which lost track of which commit a path had been chosen
 *    from — the gatherer then read every file from `repoCommits[0]`, so a path
 *    present in two repos was read from the wrong one silently. Provenance now
 *    lives in the type, and `repo` is a sufficient discriminator because the
 *    input is constrained to one commit per repo.
