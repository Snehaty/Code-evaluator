web

## Stack

Committed in `README.md` before this record existed: Next.js (TypeScript) as one app carrying
UI, CRUD API, and the orchestrator entrypoint; Postgres for all relational state; LangGraph
(TypeScript) for the Evaluator with the LLM provider left configurable; a single deployable.
The *host* for that deployable is deliberately undecided — serverless (Vercel-class) and a
long-lived Node host are both live options, and the app is built host-agnostic so the choice
can be made late. The scaffold now exists as an npm workspace: `apps/web` (Next.js) plus
`packages/contracts`, `packages/db`, `packages/orchestrator`, and
`packages/design-system-ledger`.

## Users

Two roles, and they are not variants of one person — they have different access, different
vocabulary, and opposite relationships to the code.

- **Developer** — holds the private repo. Authenticates with GitHub OAuth (`repo` scope),
  attaches repos, browses commits, and submits claims. Technical; reads SHAs fluently.
- **Stakeholder** — defines requirements as a versioned checklist and reads verdicts. Has no
  repo access and no GitHub identity. Authenticates by email magic link.

**The stakeholder relationship is deliberately unspecified.** Confirmed with the user: it may
be an agency's client, a non-technical internal manager, an investor or grant funder, or an
open-source bounty funder. The product must serve all four, so product and interface
vocabulary stays relationship-neutral — never "client", "investor", "manager", or any word
that presumes who is paying whom or why access is withheld.

## Product Purpose

Lets a developer give a stakeholder verifiable progress updates without granting direct access
to a private repo. The stakeholder defines requirements; the developer claims specific commits
satisfy a specific requirement; an LLM agent independently reads the actual code at those exact
commits and renders a per-requirement verdict; the result is recorded and made tamper-evident.

Success is a stakeholder trusting a verdict about code they will never see, without being
misled about *why* that verdict is trustworthy.

## Positioning

Independent machine attestation over real source at pinned commits, with the record's integrity
separable from the judgment's correctness. Two mechanisms, deliberately distinct:

1. An LLM agent reads real code and reports its own judgment. Not cryptographically verifiable.
2. A transparency log makes the *record* of that judgment tamper-evident after the fact. It
   proves the report was not quietly altered later. It does **not** prove the judgment was correct.

Conflating those two is the single most damaging thing any surface could do.

## Operating Context

- Requirements live as a versioned checklist. Editing text creates a new version; verification
  status attaches to the specific version it was evaluated against, never to "whatever is current".
- A developer attaches repos picked from what their own GitHub account can already see — no
  separate installation or consent step, no service credential.
- The OAuth token lives only in the developer's session and is never persisted to a table. This
  is a deliberate custody choice, not a limitation.
- Because repo reads are authenticated as the requesting developer's own live token, evaluation
  runs **synchronously inside the request that submits the claim**. The developer's own browser
  holds that request open. This follows from token custody, not from the runtime, so it holds on
  any host.
- How much Evaluator work fits in one submission depends on the deployment host, which is not
  yet chosen: a serverless platform caps it at that request's execution-time ceiling, a
  long-lived Node host does not cap it at all. Until that is settled, no surface may promise a
  bound on how long an evaluation takes, and the in-flight experience must tolerate a wait of
  minutes.
- A claim pins one requirement version set plus one or more `(repo, commit SHA)` pairs. The
  Evaluator reads those exact SHAs, never live HEAD.
- The Evaluator returns two structurally separate artifacts: an **evidence bundle** (raw tool-call
  transcript, contains real private source, stored but never shown in this phase) and a **report**
  (human language, unconditionally stakeholder-visible the moment evaluation completes).

## Capabilities and Constraints

- `requirement_versions.status` is `new` | `verified` | `eval_failed`. **`eval_failed` means the
  Evaluator returned *not satisfied*** — it is a legitimate result, not a malfunction. The enum
  name is misleading and must never reach a screen.
- Verdicts are `satisfied` | `not_satisfied`, one per requirement per evaluation.
- There is deliberately **no pending or in-flight state** anywhere, and **no human approval step**.
  Status goes directly to a terminal outcome inside the submitting request.
- `requirements.archived_at` and version status are **orthogonal**. Archiving says nothing about
  whether something was ever verified. There is no un-archive.
- Re-evaluation is symmetric from `new`, `verified`, or `eval_failed`. None is a dead end.
- Repo attachment is permanent past a 60-second undo window. No detach, no soft delete.
- `github_repo_id` and `github_user_id`, never display names, are the join keys.
- A report's `rationale` must never embed verbatim source code — file paths and line ranges are
  fine. This is a **generation-time constraint on the agent**, not a display-layer filter.
- Deliberately undecided: claim submission and verification invocation (request/response shape,
  mid-run rate-limit handling, in-flight UI); the deployment host; the transparency log backend;
  the auth library; any evidence-disclosure feature.
- **This build is a portfolio and demo piece.** Confirmed with the user: realistic placeholder
  content is acceptable and narrative clarity outranks exhaustive edge-case coverage. It does
  not license invented customers, metrics, or endorsements — see Evidence on Hand.

## Brand Commitments

Name: **ZKCVP**.

The "zero-knowledge" in that name is positioning language and **not a technical claim.** These
are binding and apply to every surface, including marketing copy:

- Never imply cryptographic zero-knowledge proofs or zkML exist anywhere in this system.
- Never imply on-chain smart-contract execution. If the transparency log ever anchors a
  checkpoint externally, that is cheap notarization, not execution.
- Never present the transparency log as evidence the LLM's judgment was correct.
- Never present a withheld evidence bundle as if it were unverifiable — integrity checking and
  content disclosure are separate operations, and the first never requires the second.

## Evidence on Hand

Real, in-repo:

- `README.md` — the map: trust model, stack, component contracts, non-goals, open questions.
- `docs/plans/01-requirement-management.md` — projects, RBAC, checklist, versioning, lifecycle.
- `docs/plans/02-repo-attachment.md` — repo attachment and commit visibility.
- `packages/design-system-ledger/` — the token layer, plain-CSS component layer, React TSX
  components, a runnable gallery, and static preview pages. Colour, font family, and spacing
  were ported from the user's Claude Design project "ZKCVP Design System"; type scale, radii,
  elevation, and motion are local. An earlier, darker visual direction was explored and
  removed; Ledger was a strict superset of it.

Absent, and **must not be fabricated**: customers, testimonials, case studies, logos, press,
pricing, licensing, uptime or accuracy benchmarks, evaluation-quality metrics, user counts, and
any deployment claim. There is no running deployment. The Evaluator does not exist yet, so no
surface may present real verdict output as if produced by it.

## Product Principles

1. **The developer's claim flow is the center of gravity.** Confirmed with the user: when the two
   sides conflict, serve the developer. If claiming is painful, nothing ever reaches a
   stakeholder and the stakeholder-facing side has nothing to show.
2. **Never let a naming artifact mislead.** `eval_failed` is a verdict; a rate limit is a failure.
   These are different events and no surface may render them as the same thing.
3. **Withheld is not unverifiable.** When content is hidden, the integrity affordance stays live
   and visible, because that distinction is the product's entire trust argument.
4. **Honesty about the trust model outranks impressiveness.** No surface borrows credibility from
   cryptography, blockchain, or determinism this system does not have.
5. **Stay relationship-neutral.** The stakeholder may be a client, a manager, a funder, or a
   stranger paying a bounty. Language that presumes which one breaks the other three.
